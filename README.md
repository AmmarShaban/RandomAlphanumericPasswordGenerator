# RandomAlphanumericPasswordGenerator
This simple python script generates a completely random alphanumeric password for you.
I created it because I found password generatoring algorthims aren't 100% random.
This script makes everything but the size of the password random such as:
1.If the charecter is uppercase letter or lowercase letter or digit or symbol
2.How many uppercase letters and lowercase letters and digits and symbols are in the password
3.What order are the uppercase letters and lowercase letters and digits and symbols are written in
So this code can generate two password that hold zero resemblance to one another
